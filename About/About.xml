Personal Rewrite of R-MK's Anthro race mod. Featuring CE patch, less spaghetti code and reduced amount of face types which now come with masking -> multicolord faces.


Original Description:
Adds anthropomorphic furry animal beings into the game, as simple as that.
Now you can play with some dog/wolf people, bird/owl people , cat people, and lizard/guilmon/yoshi? people.
That or do the ye'olde Rimworld of makin' chairs outta them.

Featuring:
- Spaghetti coding
- 8 Types of Canine heads
- 7 Types of Feline heads
- 8 Types of Avian heads
- 9 Types of Scalie heads
- 6 Types of Fish heads
- 5 Types of Rabbit heads
- 5 Types of Mustilids
- 3 Types of Rodents
- 6 Types of Bovid heads
- 1 Raccoon
- 1 Opossum


Each shape of heads have 3 variant of eyes, dot eyes, oval eyes and slanted eyes
So you can say there's about 177 unique-ish head types for your colonists :D

The stats shouuuuld be about the same as a vanilla pawn, there are some adjustments I made that I might've
forgotten about a year ago.

Might add eyelashes for the females in a later date.

Helmets might look kinda weird/funny on them.

Requires Humanoid Alien Races 2.0, remember to load that before this one.

Should be safe to add in an on-going game, Vanilla Expanded Framework/Faction Discovery is needed tho to actually
put them in-game.

They wouldn't appear in random wanderer/podcrash/rescue events so you might wanna try using Faction Blender as
well.
